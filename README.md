# e-mail_detector

In this Python file, we ca see how to detect e-mail addresses from a randomly given text file. 
The text file has been generated taken from http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/ and the e-mail adresses from https://www.randomlists.com/email-addresses

To execute the code Python 3.x and the text file at the same repository are required. You could modify the code for Py 2.7 as well.
