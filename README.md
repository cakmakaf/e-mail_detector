# E-mail Detector

We provide a tool to detect emails from a text file.


## Project Description

In this problem, we can see how to detect e-mail addresses from a randomly given text file. The text file has been generated taken from http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/ and the e-mail adresses from https://www.randomlists.com/email-addresses. 


## Files

In this repo we have:

e_mail_detector.py: This is the main file where we contribute our work for the problem.

Random_Text.txt: This file is the data set where includes a text file together with the e-mail adresses. 


## Execution

To execute the program, you need to have Python 3.x and an editor. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.X installer and not the Python 2.7 installer.
